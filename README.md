# Merit Bluepaper
This repository contains the [Merit](https://merit.me) bluepaper. You can download the PDF [here](https://github.com/meritlabs/bluepaper/raw/master/merit.pdf).

Much of what has been described in the bluepaper has been implemented in the [Merit Core](https://github.com/meritlabs/merit) 
repository. However there are some parts that are not yet implemented, notably community badges and the weave/warp scaling mechanism.
We anticipate to implement those in the future.

## Creating From LaTeX source
The bluepaper is written using [LaTeX](https://www.latex-project.org/). To create the PDF you can run the included Makefile. Note you will need to have `pdflatex` installed and a complete Latex distribution.
